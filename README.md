# bb100
A CLT that generates playlists on user Spotify account. 
# How it works
Run the script from the CL or download the main.exe file in dist/ .
The program has two use cases:
1. Scrape the billboard 100 for any date November 12th, 1955 - current and add the top 100 songs for that day to a playlist on user  spotify account.
2. **in progress** Use autoGPT model to generate playlist based on user taste and add that playlist to user spotify account.
